Processing EEG Visualisation [Generative Art]  requires EEG device

An interactive installation that uses the viewers brainwaves to manipulate the visualisation. The interaction is a conscious decision to interfere. Research into the "the self" (Psychology, Philosophy, Neuroscience, Quantum Theory) was undertaken for for the production of this piece. The installation has two visual states. The first being when the user is 'the chaos in order' trying to disrupt the flow of the piece and the other where they are trying to bring order to the chaotic behaviour. An Arduino Uno was used to extract the EEG readings from the toy headset. Inspire by the works of Casey Reas, Dan Shiffman, Craig Reynolds, Erik Mika.

Tech: Processing (Java), Ardiuno (C),
Hardware: Mindflex + Ardiuno Uno
